# Action-Recognition
model: CNN + LSTM (ConvLSTM2D)

This project based on kaggle envirnmrnt if you want to run propely I reccomend to run in Kaggle.

This project need about 60GB RAM and I found this just in Kaggle.

paths are not correct you should set them again.

some codes are extra for continue train.
You should run main code first and use extera code for saving time ex.model images and labels can be save.

This model have 93% accuracy in train dataset and 78% accuracy in test dataset.
you can use this as pretrained dataset.
